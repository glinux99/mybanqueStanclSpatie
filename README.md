## ABOUT MY BANK NURU PROJECT 
<h4 style="background: black">->PROJET EN MULTI LANGUES / PROJECT IN MULTI LANGUAGES</h4>
To launch the customer management application of a bank, in our case it is Nuru Bank, you will first have to configure the tenants  because the project was done by us using Stancl/Tenancy and Spatie/Permissions which helped us to generate the tenants as well as the permissions and roles for the users:
<p><h3>Know this</h3>
<ol>
  <li>The first customer becomes the site administrator</li>
  <li>The administrator can create agents (cashier, IT and others)</li>
  <li>The cashier created by the administrator can create a customer, can recover the deposit or the withdrawal of customers</li>
  <li>The customer can also create his account by going to my account, i.e. in this case he will have to open an account</li>
 </ol>
 <p>
 <p>
    <h3 style="color: green">Launching the app</h3>
    The first thing to do is to migrate all the tables:<br>
    ->php artisan migrate<br>
    ->creation of landlords:
        <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Codes<br>
        ->php artisan tinker<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Psy Shell v0.11.2 (PHP 7.4.28 â€” cli) by Justin Hileman<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; >>>$tenant2 = App\Models\Tenant::create(['id' => 'Kinshasa']);<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; >>> $tenant2->domains()->create(['domain' => 'kinsite.nurubanque.cd']);<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; >>> exit<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You can create as many tenants as you want<br>
    ->php artisan tenants:migrate or php artisan tenants:migrate-fresh
    ->php artisan tenants:seed name_of_the_seend (In this app name_of_the_seed = PermissionRoles)<br>
   The following steps relate to calling a tenant's link.<br>
 </p>
 <p>
    <h3>Different categories of customers</h3>
    <ol>
    <li>Admin ->First user to log into the tenant site</li>
    <li>Cashier -> user created by the administrator</li>
    <li>Simple client that can be created by the cashier or by himself</li>
    </ol>
</p>
## The customer
The customer can <br>
->to log in<br>
->modify your account<br>
->make a bank transfer<br>
